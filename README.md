**Communication contract:**

1.) Clear instructions for how to programmatically REQUEST data from the microservice (including example call)

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

2.) Clear instructions for how to programmatically RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented.

3.) UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data works. Make it detailed enough that your partner (and your grader) will understand.
